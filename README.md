# DocuBot
## HackMIT 2022 Education Track Submission

Understanding library and API documentation can be a tedious and difficult task that often involves spending hours scouring the internet looking for help on what steps to take. DocuBot aims to ease some of that stress by using OpenAI's GPT-3 model, fine-tuned on sci-kit documentation, to act as a tutor that you can ask questions about machine learning or even specific sci-kit capabilities.

Future development could include returning a list of references and further readings and implementing several popular libraries.
